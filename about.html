            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am an adaptable professional with a strong work ethic and a passion for learning. My creative mindset allows me to approach challenges with innovative solutions. I am detail-oriented, and my dedication to continuous growth makes me a valuable asset.</p>

            <p>Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Business Administration, Art, and Psychology at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). This combination of fields allows me to integrate both analytical and creative thinking, positioning me uniquely to contribute across various industries.</p>

            <p>Business Administration serves as a strong foundation for me. My past experiences in this field have shaped my approach to organizational management, economics, and strategic decision-making. Through my studies, I have developed critical skills to analyze business operations, make informed decisions, and manage projects efficiently. However, while I value these skills, my true passion lies in art and creativity, which is where I focus most of my energy. I firmly believe that business expertise can complement creativity, and I love using my business skills to bring creative visions to life in practical ways. I believe that my ability to blend creative solutions with business strategies allows me to be beneficial to others, particularly when it comes to marketing and project management. These skills can help organizations thrive while allowing me to express my artistic side in a meaningful way.</p>

            <p>I am deeply passionate about art, which I see as an essential part of my identity and currently want to focus on. My artistic abilities span a variety of mediums, and I find joy in expressing myself through graphic design, painting, and mixed media art. I create visually compelling digital content, logos, and branding materials using design tools like Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop. Beyond digital design, I am experienced in watercolor, acrylic, and oil painting, as well as creating large-scale murals. I take pride in working with different materials to create visually dynamic pieces that reflect my perspective and creativity. My artistic journey has been about more than just producing art; it has been about cultivating the mindset to think outside the box and approach challenges from a fresh, creative perspective. I love the idea of blending art with functionality—whether in marketing campaigns or in the art pieces I create—because both require innovation and attention to detail.</p>

            <p>My goal is to find opportunities that allow me to leverage my diverse skills in business, art, and psychology. I am passionate about using my business expertise to support creative projects and vice versa. Whether I am managing a marketing campaign, analyzing business data, or creating original art, I am always looking for ways to blend creativity with practicality, ensuring that everything I do is both innovative and impactful, while also wanting to help others out with my business skills.</p>
