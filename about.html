        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am an adaptable professional with a strong work ethic and a passion for learning. My creative mindset allows me to approach challenges with innovative solutions. I am detail-oriented, and my dedication to continuous growth makes me a valuable asset. Currently, I am studying Art, Business Administration, and Psychology at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). This combination of fields allows me to integrate both analytical and creative thinking, positioning me uniquely to contribute across various industries.</p>

        <p>Business Administration serves as a strong foundation for me. My past experiences in this field have shaped my approach to things such as economics, marketing, and business analytics. However, while I value these skills, my true passion lies in art and creativity, which is where I focusing currently. My artistic abilities span a variety of mediums, and I find joy in expressing myself through painting, drawing, graphic design, and mixed media art. I can create visually compelling digital content using Adobe tools and Canva. Beyond digital design, I am experienced in a variety of media such as pencil, oil pastel, watercolor, acrylic, and oil painting. I enjoy working with different materials to create visually dynamic pieces that reflect my perspective and creativity. My artistic journey has been about more than just producing art; it has been about cultivating the mindset to think outside the box and approach challenges from a fresh, creative perspective. </p>

        <p>My goal is to find opportunities that allow me to leverage my diverse skills in business, art, and psychology. I am passionate about using my business expertise to support creative projects and vice versa. I am always looking for ways to blend creativity with practicality, ensuring that everything I do is both innovative and impactful, while also wanting to help others out with my business and art skills.</p>
