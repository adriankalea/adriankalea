            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am an adaptable professional with a strong work ethic and a passion for learning. My creative mindset allows me to approach challenges with innovative solutions. I am detail-oriented, and my dedication to continuous growth makes me a valuable asset.

Currently, I am pursuing a degree in Business Administration, Art, and Psychology at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC). This diverse academic path allows me to blend analytical skills with creativity, positioning me uniquely in both the business and artistic realms.

Through my studies in Business Administration, I have built a solid foundation in key areas such as management, economics, and strategic decision-making. Business administration provides me with the critical thinking skills necessary to analyze organizational structures, identify opportunities for improvement, and lead teams toward achieving objectives. I believe in the power of data-driven decision-making, which is why I have focused on developing expertise in business analytics.

I am proficient in tools such as Google Sheets, Excel, and other data analysis platforms, allowing me to extract meaningful insights from data and support strategic business initiatives. I have also acquired basic coding skills in Python and SQL, enabling me to automate processes and enhance data analysis. In addition, I am experienced in digital marketing and social media marketing, having studied techniques to create impactful campaigns that drive brand awareness and customer engagement. My understanding of SEO, Google Analytics, and social media strategies allows me to craft campaigns that are both creative and effective.

I am passionate about project management and eager to gain hands-on experience in the field. With a strong understanding of project planning, execution, and team coordination, I am excited to apply my skills to ensure projects are completed on time, within budget, and aligned with business goals.

My passion for art is equally as integral to my identity as my business pursuits. I have talents in a variety of artistic disciplines, and I believe creativity plays a vital role in both personal expression and problem-solving. I am skilled in graphic design, where I create visually compelling digital content, logos, and branding materials. My knowledge of design software, such as Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop, enables me to bring my artistic visions to life in a professional and polished manner.

In addition to digital design, I have a strong background in painting, working with multiple mediums including watercolor, acrylic, oil painting, and mixed media art. I take great joy in expressing my creativity through both large-scale murals and smaller, intricate works of art. My ability to draw and work with different materials has allowed me to create visually dynamic pieces that reflect my unique perspective and attention to detail.

I am passionate about blending creativity with functionality, whether in my artistic works or in the business solutions I develop. I believe the ability to think outside the box, a quality nurtured through my artistic practice, is essential in any profession. It helps me approach business challenges with fresh perspectives, while also allowing me to bring innovation and originality to marketing campaigns and design projects.</p>
